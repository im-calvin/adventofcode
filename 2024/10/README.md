## Planning

### Part 1

Hiking trail:
1. as long as possible
2. even, gradual, uphill slope
2a. starts at height 0, ends at height 9, and always increases by a height of exactly 1 per step, not including diagonal steps

Trailhead: 
- starts 1 **or more** trails
- height of 0
- score is based on the number of 9-height positions reachable by that trailhead
  - smells like BFS
